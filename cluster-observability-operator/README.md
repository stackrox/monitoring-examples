# Cluster Observability Operator

The **Cluster Observability Operator (COO)** is a Kubernetes operator that simplifies the deployment and management of observability tools on OpenShift and Kubernetes clusters. It automates the installation and configuration of monitoring stack components including Prometheus, Alertmanager, and other observability tools.

The operator provides a streamlined way to set up monitoring infrastructure through Kubernetes-native custom resources, supporting features like multi-tenancy, custom metrics collection, and integration with OpenShift platform capabilities.
